# Codsoft Machine Learning Internship

Welcome to the Codsoft Machine Learning Internship! In this program, you'll be working on three exciting tasks to develop and deploy machine learning models. This README file will guide you through the details of each task and provide instructions on how to proceed.

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

### Overview
Create a machine learning model capable of predicting the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings can be employed, coupled with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

### Dataset
You can use a dataset containing movie information, including plot summaries and corresponding genres.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and text tokenization.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Utilize techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert the textual information into a format suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify the best-performing model.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune as needed.

## Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilize a dataset containing information about credit card transactions and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Dataset
You can use a dataset that includes information about credit card transactions, specifically labeling them as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle any missing or anomalous data points and scale/normalize features if necessary.
3. **Model Development:** Experiment with different algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, to build an effective fraud detection model.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Task 3: Spam SMS Detection

### Overview
Build an AI model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Utilize techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

### Dataset
Use a dataset containing labeled SMS messages, indicating whether each message is spam or legitimate.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the SMS dataset, handling any noise or irrelevant information.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Apply techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to represent SMS messages as machine-learning-friendly features.
3. **Model Training:** Train the model using classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics suitable for binary classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feel free to explore additional techniques, optimize hyperparameters, and document your progress as you tackle each task. Good luck, and enjoy your Codsoft Machine Learning Internship!
